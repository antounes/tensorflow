    "In this notebook, we will start by reviewing the main operations on tensors in TensorFlow and understand how to manipulate TensorFlow Variables. We explain how these are compatible with Python built-in `list` and NumPy `array` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we will jump to the problem of training a linear regression from scratch with gradient descent. The first order of business will be to understand how to compute the gradients of a function (a loss function here) with respect to some of its arguments (the model weights here). The TensorFlow construct allowing us to do that is `tf.GradientTape`, which we will describe.\n",
    "\n",
    "At last we will create a simple training loop to learn the weights of a 1-dim linear regression using synthetic data generated from a linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a bonus exercise, we will do the same for data generated from a non-linear model, forcing us to manual-engineer non-linear features to improve our linear model performance."
